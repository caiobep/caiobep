## Hello there

I'm a software engineer with a specialization in front-end development.

I love how computers influence our society, the possibilities that it provides are endless. Since 2015 I've been creating tools to help humans integrate computers on their day-to-day life. 

On the way I've became a *huge nerd* who loves **unix**, **design**, **cybersecurity**, **productivity**, **tools**, **gadgets**, **podcasts** and **science** among other things.

### Let's Hangout 🌎

Do you have any tool recommendations? Want to ask me something? Perhaps just a chat? Please contact me on any of the above 😁
