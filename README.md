## Hello there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

I'm a software engineer with a specialization in front-end development based in São Paulo, Brazil.

I love how computers influence our society, the possibilities that it provides are endless. Since 2015 I've been creating tools to help humans integrate computers on their day-to-day life. 

On the way I've became a *huge nerd* who loves **unix**, **design**, **cybersecurity**, **productivity**, **tools**, **gadgets**, **podcasts** and **science** among other things.


### What I'm working on:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning *Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures*, *Swift*, and *Systems Architecture*
- 💬 Ask me about anything, I am happy to help
